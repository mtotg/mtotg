👋 Hi, I’m Curtis (@mtotg)

I'm a DevOps | SysAdmin | Programmer who specalizes in architecting, building and deploying software that's performant and scales -- from the cloud to on-premise and a hybrid in-between.

I'm passionate about all things Linux & Mac. From managing, to developing and scaling 🚀. In my spare time, I'm working on learning new technologies and finding ways to use technology to help people own their data and take back their privacy. I also run my own BGP network for fun.
